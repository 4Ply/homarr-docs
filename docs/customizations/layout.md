## Sidebars

There are two sidebars available: ``right`` and ``left``.
Sidebars are additional spaces, that you can fill with apps or widgets - they do not support categories though.

It enables you to search for:
- Search results on the web

## Docker Integration

The [docker integration](/docs/integrations#üê≥-docker) enables you to interact with your docker containers.
Please note, that it [requires some initial setup](/docs/integrations#üê≥-docker).

## Pings
If you activate Pings, Homarr will send a HTTP/-S request to all your services on the page load.
When the response code matches the expected status code, the ping indicator will be green. Otherwise, it will be red.
