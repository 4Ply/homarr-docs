# Users

Each person accessing your Homarr is a user. Using the users management you can configure who has access to what boards.
A user may have multiple sessions on different devices and can log in from multiple locations at the same time.
Users will always have a username and password that they can use to log into their account.
Their password is encrypted using Bcrypt on regristration and can therefore not be read out - even with access to the database (Note: BCrypt can be brute-forced with much effort.
