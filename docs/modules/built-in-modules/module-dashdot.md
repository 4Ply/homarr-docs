# ðŸ“Ÿ Dash. Module

The Dash. module will integrate your existing Dash. instance into Homarr. The graphs will be integrated using [iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).
Additionally, you can enable or disable certain graphs, or enable the Multi-Core view for the CPU.

You can test the Module using the public Dash. Demo: https://dash.mauz.io/

:::tip

If you are accessing Dash. trough a reverse proxy, iframe might be disabled by default and the graphs cannot be loaded. Please note that iframe access must be allowed for this module.
